    <p><strong>About Me</strong></p>

    <p>I would like to use this page to tell you a little bit about my background. I was born in Laguna Hills, California where I grew up. I attended college at Cal State University of Fullerton where I received a bachelor's degree in Business Administration with an emphasis in Marketing. My work background includes customer service, sales, administration, and digital marketing related efforts.</p>

    <p>I moved to Portland, Oregon in January of 2018 in hopes to move to a new city and try something new, make some new friends and connections, and continue to grow personally and proffessionally. I currently enjoy riding my 1977 road bike to explore the city and for daily commuting.</p>

    <p>Some of my interests include recording music at home, graphic design, movies, cooking, exercising, getting outdoors, DIY projects, trying new things, learning new things, video game emulators, synthesizer emulators, and all things computer related. </p>

    <p>I have always had a passion for computers and technology. I have a strong personal connection to them because they remind me of some of fondest memories growing up. I have also always wanted to understand how to use them better because it brings me great enjoyment and I would like to use them for more valuable skill sets as well. I decided to enroll at Epicodus to fully immerse myself in this new skill set, make a career shift, and look forward growing as a future developer and continuing to pursue various projects.</p>

    <p>Here is a list of some HTML projects I have worked on at my first week at Epicodus:</p>
