      <p class"about">About Me</p>

      <div class="column">
        <p>I would like to use this page to tell you a little bit about my background. I was born in Laguna Hills, California where I grew up. I attended college at Cal State University of Fullerton where I received a bachelor's degree in Business Administration with an emphasis in Marketing. My work background includes customer service, sales, administration, graphic design, and digital marketing related efforts.</p>

        <p>I moved to Portland, Oregon in January of 2018 in hopes to try something new, make a network of new friends and connections, and to continue to grow personally and proffessionally. I currently enjoy riding my 1977 road bike for daily commuting and exploring the city.</p>

        <p>Some of my interests include <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tedef">recording music</a> at home, graphic design, movies, cooking, exercising, getting outdoors, DIY projects, trying new things, learning, video game emulators, synthesizer emulators, and all things computer related.</p>

        <p>I have always had a passion for computers and technology. I have a strong personal connection to them because they remind me of some of fondest memories growing up. I have also always wanted to understand how to use computers better because it brings me great enjoyment and I would also like to be able to utilize them for more valuable skill sets. I decided to enroll at Epicodus to fully immerse myself in a new skill set and to make a career shift. I look forward to growing as a future developer and continuing to pursue various projects.</p>
